# ðŸ“š Library Management System - Frontend

## Project Overview

This project is the **frontend client** for a Minimal Library Management System built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)**.  
It allows users to browse books, perform CRUD operations, borrow books, and view borrowing summariesâ€”all without authentication.

The frontend consumes RESTful API endpoints for backend interaction, focusing on clean UI design, type safety, and responsive user experience.
